# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Project Overview

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. Therefore, we need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. In this project, we use Python to build and evaluate several surpervised machine learning models to predict credit risk.

We adopted the following procedure:

- Oversample the data using the **RandomOverSampler** and **SMOTE** algorithms.
- Undersample the data using the **ClusterCentroids** algorithm.
- Use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the **SMOTEENN** algorithm.
- Compare two machine learning models that reduce bias, **BalancedRandomForestClassifier** and **EasyEnsembleClassifier**.

We will evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.
